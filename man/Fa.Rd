\title{Ancestral inbreeding coefficient}
\usage{
Fa(ped, Fi, name_to, genedrop = 0L, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{A dataframe containing the pedigree. Individual (id), maternal (dam), and paternal (sire) identities are mandatory columns.}

\item{Fi}{Vector of inbreeding coefficient values}

\item{name_to}{A string naming the new output column.}

\item{genedrop}{Number of genedrop iterations to run. If set to zero (as default), Ballou's Fa is computed.}

\item{seed}{Sets a seed for the random number generator.}
}
\value{
The input dataframe, plus an additional column named "Fa" with individual ancestral inbreeding coefficient values.
}
\description{
Computes the ancestral inbreeding coefficient (\emph{Fa}).
This is the probability that an allele has been in homozygosity in at least one ancestor (Ballou 1997).
A genedrop approach is included to compute unbiased estimates of \emph{Fa} (Baumung et al. 2015).
